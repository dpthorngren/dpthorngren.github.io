	<p><strong>Research:</strong><br>
        I am the 2019 Trottier postdoctoral fellow at iREx at the university of Montreal (UdeM).
        I recently completed my Ph.D in Physics at UC Santa Cruz, where I studied exoplanets with my advisor
        <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~jfortney/">Jonathan Fortney</a>.
        At UdeM, I am continuing and expanding on that work using computer models of exoplanet structure
        and thermal evolution in conjunction with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian statistics</a> to better
        understand these objects.  These days, I am particularly excited to study hot Jupiters, which are
        surprisingly large for their mass.  To this end, I am interested in their
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...831...64T/abstract">compositions</a>,
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..214T/abstract">heat flows</a>, and the
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...874L..31T/abstract">observable</a>
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190707777T/abstract">characteristics</a>
        that can test the resulting hypotheses.
        <p>
        These are exciting times for exoplanetary science.  Thanks to observing
        programs like <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler</a>,
        <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/COROT/COROT_objectives">CoRoT</a>,
        and many others, a myriad of
        discoveries have been made since the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12">first confirmed discovery in 1992</a>.
        These have presented us with types of planets
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Earth">not</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter">seen</a> in the solar system and
        many fascinating questions.  Why are hot Jupiters so large?  What
        are these planets composed of?  How does
        planet formation work?  How unusual is the solar system?
        Can any of these planets support life? Do they?
        </p>
        <p>
        Giant planets, though not habitable themselves, can help with
        contextualizing and answering these questions.  These objects were
        likely critical in shaping the planetary systems they are found in,
        and provide a record of the composition of the disk they formed in.
        Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit-timing_variation">
        TTVs</a> can reveal smaller planets and help constrain the properties
        of those already observed.  They may even have
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exomoon">moons</a> which could
        shelter life (though no discoveries of exomoons have yet been confirmed).
        Of course, there is also much left to learn about giant planets themselves.
        Thanks to missions like 
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/">Juno</a>,
        <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/">Cassini</a>,
        and <a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS</a>, we are in a
        position to dramatically improve our understanding of them as well
        over the coming years.
